#### <a id="tighter-measures"></a> Tighter Measures To Minimise Further Spread Of Covid-19

**Enhanced Precautions for UK/US Returnees**

For Singapore residents arriving from the UK and US, it is mandatory for all Singaporeans returning from US and UK and arriving from 25 Mar 2359 onwards to stay at designated government-arranged facilities for the duration of their Stay Home Notice (SHN) period. Transportation will be arranged to send the returnees directly from the airport to the hotels. Each will have their own room/toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals. These SHN requirements will be strictly enforced so as to reduce the risk of community transmission from imported cases. 

This new SHN arrangement will take effect for all UK/US returnees from 25 March 2020, 2359 hours. All returnees from the UK and US who are presently still serving out their SHN in their homes may also apply to stay in these dedicated facilities. They can contact the SHN Helpline at 6812-5555 for more information.

**Singapore Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders who Disregard Travel Advisory**

Any Singapore resident or Long Term Pass holder who leaves Singapore from 27 March 2020, in disregard of the prevailing travel advisories, will be charged at unsubsidised rates for their inpatient stay at public hospitals, if they are admitted for suspected COVID-19 and have onset of symptoms within 14 days of returning to Singapore. Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.
